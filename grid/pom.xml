  <name>OODT Web Grid</name>
  <description>The OODT grid services (product and profile services) use CORBA or
    RMI as their underlying network transport.  However, limitations
    of CORBA and RMI make them inappropriate for large-scale
    deployments.  For one, both are procedural mechanisms, providing a
    remote interface that resembles a method call.  This makes
    streaming of data from a service impossible, because there are
    limitations to the sizes of data structures that can be passed
    over a remote method call.  Instead, repeated calls must be made
    to retrieve each block of a product, making transfer speeds
    horribly slow compared to HTTP or FTP.  (Block-based retrieval of
    profiles was never implemented, resulting in out of memory
    conditions for large profile results, which is another problem.)
    Second, both CORBA and RMI rely on a central name registry.  The
    registry makes an object independent of its network location,
    enabling a client to call it by name (looking up its last known
    location in the registry).  However, this requires that server
    objects be able to make outbound network calls to the registry
    (through any outbound firewall), and that the registry accept
    those registrations (through any inbound firewall).  This required
    administrative action at institutions hosting server objects and
    at the institution hosting the registry.  Often, these firewall
    exceptions would change without notice as system adminstrators
    changed at each location (apparently firewall exceptions are
    poorly documented everywhere).  Further, in the two major
    deployments of OODT (PDS and EDRN), server objects have almost
    never moved, nullifying any benefit of the registry.  This
    project, OODT Web Grid Services, avoids the prolems of CORBA and
    RMI by using HTTP as the transport mechanism for products and
    profiles.  Further, it provides a password-protected mechanism to
    add new sets of product and profile query handlers, enabling
    seamless activation of additional capabilities.</description>
  <!-- All dependencies should be listed in core/pom.xml and be ordered alphabetically by package and artifact.
     Once the dependency is in the core pom, it can then be used in other modules without the version tags.
     For example, within core/pom.xml:

      <dependency>
      <groupId>com.amazonaws</groupId>
      <artifactId>aws-java-sdk</artifactId>
      <version>1.7.4</version>
    </dependency>

     Elsewhere in the platform:
     <dependency>
      <groupId>com.amazonaws</groupId>
      <artifactId>aws-java-sdk</artifactId>
    </dependency>

     Where possible the same dependency version should be used across the whole platform but if required the version
     can be overridden in a specific pom and should have a comment explaing why the version has been overridden
