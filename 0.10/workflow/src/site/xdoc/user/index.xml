      <div class="warning">This document is in the process of being reorganized as
      part of our ongoing documentation effort. Please follow the links below to find
      information that has previously been hosted on this page.</div>
 

      <p>We are in the process of upgrading OODT documentation. In the near
      future, we hope to provide information for developers regarding each 
      component, including its purpose, structure, interfaces, and 
      configuration points in a <a href="../development/developer.html">Developer
      Guide.</a></p>
      
      <p>Information for users, including installation and basic configuration,
      as well as example usage are provided in a 
      <a href="../user/basic.html">Basic User Guide.</a> Advanced topics, like
      look and feel, lessons-learned, and best practices are provided in an
      <a href="../user/advanced.html">Advanced User Guide.</a></p>
      
      <p>Finally, we are planning to provide a number of case studies in the 
      future, in which multi-component deployments are configured to handle
      common data and computation management scenarios.</p>
