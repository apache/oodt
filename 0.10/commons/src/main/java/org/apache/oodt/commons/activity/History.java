/**
 * A history of incidents to be stored in long-term storage.
 *
 * The <code>History</code> tracks Incidents that occurred during the course of an
 * activity.  It's a temporary container for incidents before the activity is deemed
 * complete and stored into whatever the long-term {@link Storage} is.  A
 * <code>History</code> starts out with at least one {@link Incident} received from
 * (usually remote) processing.  Other incidents arrive through {@link #addIncident} and
 * must have the same ID.  Eventually, one of those incidents will be an
 * <code>ActivityStopped</code> incident, which then schedules the History to commit
 * itself.
 *
 * <p>It doesn't commit itself right away though; other incidents may arrive that are part
 * of the activity out of order, so there's a delay of {@link #closeTime} milliseconds
 * before it's sent to {@link Storage}.  Other incidents will be recorded during this delay.
 *
 * <p>It's also possible that the <code>ActivityStopped</code> incident never arrives from
 * the process that deems the activity stopped.  In that case, the idle timer (which is
 * reset whenever an incident arrives) determines when to put the <code>History</code>
 * into its commital state.  The stop can arrive after this point (and will be recorded),
 * but it otherwise doesn't affect the commit-to-close time.
