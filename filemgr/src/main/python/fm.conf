# The path gives the name of the directory where the Lucene search engine
# will build its indexes.  The path refers to a directory; it will be created
# if it doesn't exist.  If it does exist, it must refer to an
# existing Lucene index with correct sub-files present.  So, don't make this
# directory manually, or you'll be confused by error messages!

[policies]
# The 'repo' and 'validation' are comma-separated lists of URLs.  Typically, they
# contain a single "file:" style URL that names a directory with policy XML files
# within.  The 'user' identifies the user database.  It'll be created if it
# doesn't exist.
