	Description: This file configures the CAS RSS web service. The
	main aspects of this file are the ability to recast a product's 
	metadata as relevant RSS compatiable tags.

<!-- FIXME: adjust namespace URI? -->
<cas:rssconf xmlns:cas="http://oodt.jpl.nasa.gov/1.0/cas">
  <!-- 
    An option "channelLink" attribute may be set on the above outer tag to 
    set the channel's link attribute.
    
    Metadata available for replacement in this attribute is:
    
    BaseUrl: the base URL for the CAS web service layer.
    ProductTypeId: the id passed to the RSS channel via the id param
    ProductType: the channel product type name passed via the channel param
    TopN: the topn param, if passed.
   -->
  
  <!-- 
    Each &lt;tag&gt; tag defines 2 attributes:
    
    name (required) - the RSS output tag name
    source (optional) - the field name from the CAS product's metadata and its
    associated value.
    
    Each &lt;tag&gt; has a set of &lt;attribute&gt; tags, which define XML attributes
    on the RSS output tags. Each &lt;attribute&gt; has the following attributes:
    
    name (required) - the RSS output tag attribute name
    value (required) - the RSS output tag attribute value. By default these values are
    run through PathUtils#replaceEnvVariables which replaces met keys using the standard
    CAS met replacement strategy.

    <!-- 
    
    If you want to turn your CAS File Manager into a Podcast feeder for iTunes, uncomment
    the below tag block. You'll need to modify your web.xml for this webapp and change
    the default name of the /data service to /data.mp3. Then you're set!
    
    <tag name="enclosure">
      <attribute name="url" value="http://localhost:8080/fmprod/data.mp3?productID=[CAS.ProductId]"/>
      <attribute name="length" value="[FileSize]"/>
      <attribute name="type" value="audio/mpeg"/>
    </tag>
    
    -->

    <!-- 
    
    If you want to turn your CAS File Manager into a GeoRSS 
    simple service (see http://georss.org/simple), add the 
    following block, assuming that you have indexed met fields 
    named Latitude and Longitude for your product (update as 
    appropriate otherwise).
    
    <tag name="georss:point" source="[Latitude] [Longitude]"/>
    -->
    
    <tag name="cas:source" source="[ProductType]"/>
    <tag name="source" source="[ProductType]"/>
